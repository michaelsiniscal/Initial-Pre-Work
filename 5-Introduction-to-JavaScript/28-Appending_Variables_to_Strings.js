// Learned how to append a variable string with another using the += operator

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "totally cool!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
