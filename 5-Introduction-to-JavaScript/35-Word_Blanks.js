// Learned how to create a form string using word blanks to set up variable parts

function wordBlanks(myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, myAdverb) {
  // Your code below this line
  var result= myAdjective+" hairy "+myNoun+" likes to "+myVerb+" very "+myAdverb;

  // Your code above this line
  return result;

// Change the words here to test your function
wordBlanks("dog", "big", "ran", "quickly");
