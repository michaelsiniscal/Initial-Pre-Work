// Learned how to add a completely new property name and attribute to an existing object. Starting to make more sense and was able to use last couple lessons to write test code.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

// Setup
var myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
myDog.bark = "woof"

var sound = myDog["bark"];
console.log(sound);
