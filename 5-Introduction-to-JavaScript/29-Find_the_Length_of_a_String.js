// Learned how to find the character length of a string using .length function...all very similar to functionos in excel..I see what I'm supposed to do, but don't see where the output of 8 would appear

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
